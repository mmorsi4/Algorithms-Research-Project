# Advanced Algorithms & Complexity  
**Spring 2025 · CSE332 / CSE245 · Ain Shams University**

A group project tackling six challenging algorithmic puzzles and a comparative study of three NP-type problems. Implementations are in C++, Java, and C#, with some visualizations and clear documentation.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
- **Colored Tromino Tiling**  
- **Knight’s Tour**  
- **Four-Peg Tower of Hanoi**  
- **Six-Knight Swap**  
- **Shooter’s Gambit**  
- **Crossing Dots**  
- **NP Showdown**: Hamiltonian Circuits, Partitioning & Graph Coloring  

We applied divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy methods, backtracking, heuristic search, and more. Each solution is analyzed for time and space complexity and compared against alternative approaches.
